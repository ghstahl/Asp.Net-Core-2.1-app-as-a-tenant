# AspNetCoreApp-in-azure-function

API only so far.

I am most likely commiting heresy here, but did you know that you can run the **[Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost.TestServer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.testhost.testserver?view=aspnetcore-2.1 )** in an Azure function.
